                        To work in a place where passion, love for design and happiness emerges.
                         To be surrounded by passionate designers those encourage me to become a better person every day, 
                         working towards a common goal, without any competition. Every day, I know that I can count on my DKORistas.
                         To work in a place where everyone enjoys their work and feels passionate about it, where we all help each other 
                         and work as a team to design our clients dream homes.!<br><br>

                        Passionate, fun, creative designers that really listen to our clients to provide them with design solutions that fit their design needs.

                    <p>I’m Ivonne Ronderos, and I started IN Interiors in 2004.<br> Growing up in a family of entrepreneurs inspired me to create
                         a different kind of interior design firm, one that puts empathy and service at the core—and delivers good design as well. 
                         Almost 15 years later, I’m still a DKORista at heart! I get excited to begin each new project, love to see the look on our 
                         clients’ faces during the “big reveal” moment, and for everything in between.<br><br>
           
                           <b>What inspires me?</b></br>                
                           What I love the most about what I do is the way it changes people’s lives (our clients and our team members).
                            My colleagues, clients and all of the amazing vendors and the extended team we get to work with always inspires me to be better.<br>
